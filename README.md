# Heisenberg-Spin-Chain
A python program to solve heisenberg spi half chain using Lanczos algorithm.

You just input the value of N and J, (number of lattice sites and the exchange integral), the program will give you all the relevant energy eigenvalues.

To understand the background problem and the algorithm behind the code read the pdf file.
